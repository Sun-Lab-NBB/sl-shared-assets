    This function is used to initially configure any machine to work with Sun lab data stored on remote compute
    server(s) by setting up the local working directory for all remote data processing pipelines and tasks. The path
    to the working directory is stored inside the user's data directory so that all Sun lab libraries can automatically
    access and use the same working directory. Since the storage directory is typically hidden and varies between OSes
    and machines, this function provides a convenient way for setting that path without manually editing the storage
    cache.
